                Hi! I'm PJ

                <br>
                I'm 18 years old and love to make things
                <br>
                <br>
                When younger, I liked to build with electronics and scraps.
                I once created a lego yt channel that gained <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SquabbleProductions" target="_blank"  class="link">>15 mil views.</a> 
                Nowadays, I aim to create stuff to help ppl. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I recently started another <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2hlN8nkIE6jQl7qLvJFRNA" target="_blank"  class="link">yt channel</a> showing some of my 
                projects. There's not much yet but hoping to expand it over time. 
                you can check it out, maybe you'll find something interesting. 
                <br>
                <br>
                As far as my interests, I love math, engineering, and cs. 
                I'm an freshman @ Wayne State University majoring in 
                computer & electrical engineering with a minor in cs. through WSU, I'm 
                hoping to turn my passion for making things into a career.

                (here is my promposal I made with wood, scraps, & an arduino)
                <br>
                <br>
                I also am into music and film. my fav artists are sza, daniel caesar,
                & frank ocean, but i'll listen to pretty much anything. I love A24 and
                Studio Ghibli films. Whenever I have the chance, I spend time making
                short films; my dream is to publish one someday.
                <br>
                <br>
                When I'm not busy with projects or school, I spend a lot of time running, playing
                bball, and hanging out w my gf. I'm always rooting for detroit sports teams, & 
                you could often catch me watching the pistons at the little caesars arena.
